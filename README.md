1AfricaRadioTV is a multi-lingual, mass communication platform, set up in Johannesburg, South Africa to begin the task of re-branding the continent by telling the truthful story of an emergent Africa with the best human and natural resource that puts it above others. Our Pan-African contents are carefully packaged in line with this mission which is mostly aimed at not only marketing the continent but bringing all of us together with a unified sense of commitment and service. We are the gateway to the world hence we are “Africa Embassy”… (“Africa…we are one.”)
